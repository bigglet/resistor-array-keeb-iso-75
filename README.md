# Altium files for 75% ISO Keyboard

## [Layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/e980f3140afb87eb44446a4f703c6d81)

The layout is based on a 75% ISO layout using Cherry MX soldered switches. These will be mounted using a backplate to increase the ridgidity of the board. [Plate Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/) will generate the plate design.
